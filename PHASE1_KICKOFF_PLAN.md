## Daily Coordination Rhythm

### Daily Standup Structure
**Time**: 10:00 AM (via Dashboard when available, Slack until then)  
**Duration**: 15 minutes maximum  
**Format**:
1. **Yesterday** (2 min per person)
   - What was completed
   - Any blockers encountered
2. **Today** (2 min per person)
   - Primary focus tasks
   - Any help needed
3. **Blockers** (5 min total)
   - Immediate resolution or escalation
   - Assignment of unblocking tasks

### Communication Channels
- **Primary**: Team Dashboard (once operational)
- **Backup**: Slack/Discord channel #team-dashboard
- **Code Reviews**: GitHub Pull Requests
- **Documentation**: Markdown files in repository
- **Urgent Issues**: Direct message to Project Manager

### Workflow Coordination

#### Code Integration Process
1. **Feature branches**: `feature/[specialist]-[feature-name]`
2. **Daily integration**: Merge to `develop` branch
3. **Review requirement**: Lead Developer approval
4. **Testing**: Must pass CI/CD checks
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant .md files

#### Blocker Resolution SLA
- **Critical** (blocks others): 2 hours
- **High** (blocks individual): 4 hours  
- **Medium** (workaround exists): 24 hours
- **Low** (nice to have): 48 hours

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| WebSocket complexity | High | Start with simple echo server, iterate |
| Monorepo build issues | Medium | Use proven configurations from similar projects |
| Integration delays | Medium | Daily integration, not waiting until week end |
| Team availability | Low | Backup assignments documented |

### Contingency Plans
- If WebSocket delayed: Use HTTP polling temporarily
- If monorepo issues: Start with simple structure, refactor later
- If frontend blocked: Mock WebSocket data for UI development
