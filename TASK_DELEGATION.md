3. Set up Prometheus exporters
4. Create performance benchmarks

**Metrics to Collect**:
- CPU usage (per core and aggregate)
- Memory (RSS, heap, available)
- Disk I/O and usage
- Network throughput
- Process count and states
- Agent-specific resource usage

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Real metrics from psutil integration
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint (/metrics)
- [ ] Sub-second collection latency
- [ ] Historical data in InfluxDB

## Notes for Specialists

### code-quality-refactoring-specialist
Focus on maintainability over performance initially. We can optimize after the structure is correct.

### frontend-expert
Prioritize real-time responsiveness. Users should see immediate feedback for all actions.

### performance-engineering-specialist
Set up monitoring before optimization. We need baselines for comparison.

### monorepo-architecture-specialist
Ensure all packages follow consistent patterns. This sets precedent for future development.

### chrome-extension-specialist
Keep the extension lightweight. Core logic should remain in the main application.

### stripe-subscription-expert
Start with simple tier structure. We can add complexity based on user feedback.

### data-processing-csv-expert
Focus on automated reports. Manual exports are secondary priority.
